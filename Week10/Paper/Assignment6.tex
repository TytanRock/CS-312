\section{Problem 1}
\subsection{Question}
Show that it is undecidable if two TMs accept the same language.
\subsection{Answer}

\section{Problem 2}
\subsection{Question}
Show that $ALL_{DFA} \in \mathcal{P}$. That is, show that you can test in polynomial time whether a DFA accepts every string.
\subsection{Answer}

\section{Problem 3}
\subsection{Question}
Show that the set $\mathcal{P}$ is closed under the star operation. (Hint: Dynamic Programming)
\subsection{Answer}

\section{Problem 4}
\subsection{Question A}
Define SPATH as the set of $<G, a, b, k>$ such that $G$ is a graph with a path from $a$ to $b$ of length at most $k$. Show that SPATH is in $\mathcal{P}$.
\subsection{Question B}
Define LPATH as the set of $<G,a,b,k>$ such that $G$ is a graph with a path from $a$ to $b$ without repeated nodes of length at least $k$. Show that LPATH is $\mathcal{NP}$-Complete. (You may assume NP-completeness of 
HAMPATH).
\subsection{Answer A}
\subsection{Answer B}

\section{Problem 5}
\subsection{Question}
Show that if $\mathcal{P=NP}$, then every language in $\mathcal{P}$ except $\emptyset$ and $\Sigma^{*}$ is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\subsection{Answer}

\section{Problem 6}
\subsection{Question}
Show that the CLIQUE problem is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete by reducing from VERTEX\_COVER.
\subsection{Answer}

\section{Problem 7}
\subsection{Question}
Convince your instructor that you understood this course.
\subsection{Answer}
