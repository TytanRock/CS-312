The set of binary nonpalindromes can be interpreted as the complement expression of binary palindromes.
If Palindromes are regular, we know that nonpalindromes are regular, and if palindromes are not regular we know that nonpalindromes are not regular.
Palindromes are not regular by the Pumping Lemma.
Prove palindromes aren't regular by the pumping lemma.
