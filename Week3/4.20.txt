The definition of a Finite Automaton is that it contains a finite number of states.
In order to accept a language that has the same number of 0's and 1's, the Finite Automata must count the number of 0's and compare it to the number of 1's.
Since the string that passes into the Finite Automata can be arbitrarily large, the Finite Automata must count arbitrarily many 0's and 1's.
Since arbitrarily many 0's and 1's can be infinite, the Finite Automata must have infinite states.
A Finite Automata cannot have infinite states, so there doesn't exist a Finite Automata that accepts that language.
