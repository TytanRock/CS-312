a: 
q0, initial state, transitions to itself on '0' and pushes 'X' to the first stack. Also transitions to q1 on nothing.
q1, transitions to itself on '1' and pops 'X' from the first stack, pushes 'X' to the second stack. Also transitions to q2 on nothing.
q2, transitions to itself on '2' and pops 'X' from the second stack. Transitions to q3 on nothing, pops Z from both stacks, pushes Z to both stacks.
q3, final state.

b:
q0, initial state, transitions to itself on '0' and pushes 'X' to the first stack. Also transitions to q1 on nothing.
q1, transitions to itself on '1' and pops 'X' from the first stack, pushes 'X' to the second stack. Also transitions to q2 on nothing, popping Z and pushing Z on the first stack.
q2, transitions to itself on '2' and pops 'X' from the second stack, pushes 'X' to the first stack. Also transitions to q3 on nothing, popping Z and pushing Z on the second stack.
q3, transitions to itself on '3' and pops 'X' from the first stack. Transitions to q4 on nothing, pops Z from both stacks, pushes Z to both stacks.
q4, final state.

c:
q0, initial state, transitions to itself on 0, pushes 0 to the first stack. Transitions to itself on 1, pushes 1 to the first stack. Transitions to q1 on #
# At this point q1 has the reverse order of everything from the first x
q1, transitions to itself on nothing, pops 0 from the first stack, pushes 0 to the second stack. Transitions to itself on nothing, pops 1 from the first stack, pushes 1 to the second stack. Transitions to q2 on nothing, pops Z from the first stack, pushes Z to the first stack.
# At this point the second stack has the order from the first part of the problem in order
q2, transitions to itself on 0, pops 0 from the second stack. Transitions to itself on 1, pops 1 from the second stack. Transitions to q3 on nothing, pops Z from the second stack, pushes Z to the second stack.
q3, final state.
