Assume there is a special symbol at the start of the one-way tape, and move to the right by one.
When translating a classical two-way infinite tape turing machine into a one-way infinite tape turing machine, follow these instructions.
 1. If transitioning to the right while "positive", instead transition to the right twice
 2. If transitioning to the left while "positive", instead transition to the left twice
 3. If transitioning to the right while "negative", instead transition to the left twice
 4. If transitioning to the left while "negative", instead transition to the right twice
 5. If, while transitioning, you encounter the special symbol, follow these steps
  a. If you are negative (you have transitioned twice), you are now positive, transition to the right by one
  b. If you are positive (you have transitioned once), you are now negative, transition to the right by two
